              <p>
                Hello again! üëã I'm Jose Lemus, a second-year Software Development Engineering student based in El
                Salvador.
                I'm currently focused on front-end development and steadily building my way toward becoming a full
                stack
                developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I chose this path because it fits naturally with who I am: someone who‚Äôs passionate about the English
                language, who loves working with computers, and who‚Äôs drawn to the creative and global nature of web
                development.
                To me, coding feels like a chill and meaningful way to build things that matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                I‚Äôm especially excited about projects that people actually use ‚Äî like e-commerce platforms, movie
                websites, and interactive apps (both web and mobile).
                While I haven‚Äôt built one of those yet, I‚Äôm learning every day with the goal of getting there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of code, I enjoy reading in English, improving my language skills, hiking in nature, and
                exploring new cultures when I get the chance to travel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right now, my priority is mastering front-end development before moving deeper into back-end and
                databases.
                One day, I want to be a full stack developer ‚Äî and I believe an internship would be a great next step,
                helping me learn while contributing to a real team.
              </p>
              <p>
                My personal goal is to become a full stack developer. This website is where I document the projects,
                experiments, and learning milestones that I complete along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                I try to remind myself often: <em>‚ÄúOne step at a time.‚Äù</em>
                This world is massive, and the only way to truly grow in it is to move forward patiently and
                persistently ‚Äî never rushing the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe in learning by building, and I‚Äôm excited to keep leveling up through practice and
                exploration.
                Thanks for stopping by and being part of the journey!
              </p>
